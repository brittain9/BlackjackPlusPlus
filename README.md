# Alex's BlackJack

### Todo:

Optimize code

Implement all bets found in a real blackjack game including insurance and others.

BlackJack Strategy Tester: Implement an AI that can perform BlackJack strategies and simulate the performance of these strategies.

Test shuffle randomness and shuffle cards better if needed. Just using std::shuffle right now. For the strategy tester, if the shuffling is not completely random then the results may be skewed.


## Bigger Todos:

Create graphics using OpenGL to play in an actual window instead of console.

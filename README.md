# Alex's BlackJack
### Possible Improvements:
Add the two other more common side bets: perfect pairs and 21+3

Implement my own shuffle deck function. Using std::shuffle, std::reverse, and my rng to shuffle the deck right now.

Clean up console UI. It's perfectly playable and looks okay but could use a nice overhaul. Don't want to do though because I want to learn OpenGL.

## Todos:
Create graphics using OpenGL to play in an actual window instead of console.

BlackJack Strategy Tester: Implement an AI that can perform BlackJack strategies and simulate the performance of these strategies.

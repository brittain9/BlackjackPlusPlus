# Alex's BlackJack

### Todo:
Refactor code and fix rushed parts.
Finish all features of BlackJack including splitting, double down, other features not so far added.
Implement chips and bets.
Optimize code further.

## Bigger Todos:
BlackJack Strategy Tester: Implement an AI that can perform BlackJack strategies and simulate the performance of these strategies.
Create graphics using OpenGL to play in an actual window instead of console.

I have learned a lot since I wrote the first commit. I solved a lot of problems that code had including the major stack overflow issue that occured after several loops of the game.

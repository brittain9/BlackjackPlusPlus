# Alex's BlackJack

### Todo:
Refactor code and fix rushed parts.

Implement chips and bets.
Optimize code further.

## Bigger Todos:
BlackJack Strategy Tester: Implement an AI that can perform BlackJack strategies and simulate the performance of these strategies.
Create graphics using OpenGL to play in an actual window instead of console.

First Commit Description that I wrote three months before the current (third) commit:
My C++ code for Blackjack as part of learnCPP chp10 quiz. The most challenging part of this code was getting the Ace to equal 11 or 1. This version works correctly for the current testing I have done. I plan to release version 2 that utilizes classes more, is cleaner, and just to learn more about git.

I have learned a lot since I wrote the first commit. I solved a lot of problems that code had including the major stack overflow issue that occured after several loops of the game.
